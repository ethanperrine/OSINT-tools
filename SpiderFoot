This is a very powerful tool that automates OSINT for threat intelligence and mapping your attack surface. What makes SpiderFoot so powerful because SpiderFoot is an open source intelligence (OSINT) automation tool. It integrates with just about every data source available and utilises a range of methods for data analysis, making that data easy to navigate.

SpiderFoot has an embedded web-server for providing a clean and intuitive web-based interface but can also be used completely via the command-line. It's written in Python 3 and GPL-licensed.

With spiderfoot you can find the following:

    IP address
    Domain/sub-domain name
    Hostname
    Network subnet (CIDR)
    ASN
    E-mail address
    Phone number
    Username
    Person's name
    Bitcoin address
